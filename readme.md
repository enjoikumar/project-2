#Approach taken
The approach I took was I tackled the API first, and I felt I had a good handle on it, until Sunday night, when I got an unknown error about my API, stating error API Keys, which freaked me out. I went into panic mode and just was having trouble figuring out what to do. I then just obtained new keys, and that worked fine. But in the instance of freaking out, I thought to myself, why don't I do what I know before I tackle something that I have the least reps with. So I put aside the API function and created a working CRUD App. After getting the new keys, I worked on the API, and integrating it into the app, which led me to the most trouble. Then all of Tuesday, I was able to access the API, but not being able to display the image shown, and that just frustrated me the most, and I couldn't figure it out. I have the image URL, but it's not displaying properly on my index.

#Installation instructions
I feel I bit off more than I could chew but I feel in the process of that, I was able to learn more about user experience and what I want my app to do, and what it can do. Flickr has an NPM package and I could intall it that way, which was easier than calling upon the keys each and every time I wanted to call on the function. 

#Unsolved Problems
I was able to access the API, and be able to get an appropriate image depending on what the user was able to input, and console log the input. I'm not able to render the actual image, I can get the url, but It's not displaying properly and I'm stuck at figuring out why.
